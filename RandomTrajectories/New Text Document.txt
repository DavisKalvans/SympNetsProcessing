Verlet Sym Pendulum tests

	Sigmoid
		non sch
			1e-1 too big
			1e-2 does start to go down, but oscilates at end
			1e-3 too small with 50'000 epochs; still to small with 200'000 epochs
		sch
			eta1 1e-1 eta2 1e-2 works really well, maybe could do longer; little better if any at 100'000 epochs
			eta1 1e-1 eta2 1e-3 doesn't work
			eta1 1 eta2 1e-3 works well (no jumps at the end) but jumpy at first
			eta1 1 eta2 1e-5 works okay, but not as good as with eta2 1e-3
			eta1 1 eta2 1e-4 doesn't work

	Linear
		non sch
			1e-1 too big
			1e-2 too big, and carzy oscilations sometimes
			1e-3 too small with 50'000 epochs; still to small with 200'000 epochs
